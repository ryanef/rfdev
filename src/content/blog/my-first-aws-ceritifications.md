In 2015 before I knew anything at all about cloud, I was looking for a cheap way to host a Wordpress blog when I found an article that mentioned using AWS free tier services to accomplish that. I followed a tutorial on spinning up an EC2 server and Route53 to get Wordpress running in the cloud. It worked, but like many other big ideas I had at the time, the site was quickly forgotten about and for the time being that was the end of my experience with AWS.

In 2021 I decided to move in a direction career direction and after talking to a co-worker who's a cloud engineer I became very interested in that. I booked my first exam, the SAA-C02, for April 2021. I passed the SAA-C02 and went on to pass the Developer and SysOps Administrator Associate exams within the next year.

### Resources Used:
I used mostly the three sources below for all 3 AWS Associate certifications. Of course the official AWS documentation is a gold mine but all 3 resources below will provide you plenty of links to the relevant docs for the certification you’re taking.

Adrian Cantrill - https://learn.cantrill.io/

Stephane Mareek - https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/

Jon Bonso Practice Exams- https://tutorialsdojo.com

You don’t need both Adrian and Stephane’s courses to pass the certification. One or the other should suffice. I used Adrian’s course as a primary study tool and Stephane’s as a supplement. Adrian’s courses have detailed projects that you develop throughout the course that provide real world type experience. Adrian’s courses have more hours of content whereas Stephane’s are shorter and straight to the point for simply passing the certification. If I had to recommend only one, it would be Adrian’s for the projects since you get to do cool stuff like convert a monolithic web app into running on serverless architecture.

You will need Jon Bonso’s practice certifications regardless of whose course you purchase. The review mode on these exams are a complete game changer since Jon has very detailed explanations on why wrong answers are wrong and that had a lot of value for me.

### My background
I’ve been a life long learner when it comes to computers and have taught myself a good bit about programming, networking and server administration over the years but certainly not an expert in any of those areas. I did SEO and Wordpress development prior to 2014. Before switching into studying for cloud in 2020, I was studying to be a front-end web developer.

### My process
If I thought it would take me 12 weeks to finish a course, I would schedule the exam for 14 weeks away. 12 and 14 weeks are arbitrary numbers just to make an example, not a guideline you should go by. You shouldn’t speed through these courses and should really try to internalize the content. I try to keep about 2 weeks space between finishing a course and the real exam so I have time for doing 6 practice exams. If you fall behind and can’t make your exam date, PearsonVUE does give the ability to change your exam date but you must give them more than 24 hour notice. This is about how I scheduled studying for my 3 certs:

Watched Adrian’s course from beginning to end. I took notes in OneNote because it syncs between phone and computer.
Two weeks away from the exam, started Jon Bonso’s practice exams. There are usually 6 practice exams.
Take and review the first exam. I use hand-written notes in this part because I feel it helps better with memory.
After first practice exam and review, I would spend the next day using Stephane Mareek’s course to review areas I felt weak. His videos are short and straight to the point about certification content. If you only have Adrian’s course, then use his videos on something like 1.25x or 1.5x speed for review.
Continue to alternate practice exam days and going back to course content.
There are several reasons I start the practice exams roughly 2 weeks away from the exam. One reason is Jon Bonso usually has 6 practice exams available so you want plenty of time to get through it. The time required to take the practice exam then review it will be 4-6 hours. That’s a lot to study for one day.

The other reason is the exams are very realistic and difficult which can be mentally taxing. A lot of people, including myself, let a failed practice exam get them in a negative mental state. If you don’t believe me, just search r/AWSCertifications for “is jon bonso’s practice exam harder than the real thing?” So for me, it just wasn’t a good idea to do these practice exams on back to back days.

The practice exams will be hard but don’t be discouraged if you fail a few of them. I failed a couple practice exams for SAA-C02 and nearly cancelled the exam.  It’s not that Jon’s tests are so much harder than the real thing but they are a crucial part of the learning process. The practice exam reviews are as important as the courses you watch. That’s why I try to start taking them 2 weeks before the real exam and I alternate days something like this:

Monday: practice exam + review the exam - read explanations for EVERYTHING
Tuesday: go over notes and review Adrian or Stephane’s courses.
Wednesday: practice exam + review the exam
Thursday: go over notes and review Adrian or Stephane’s courses.
Friday: practice exam + review the exam
Saturday: go over notes and review Adrian or Stephane’s courses.
The practice exams are stressful but without them I wouldn’t have passed. Keep in mind this is all just my experience and I’m sure there are many who have successfully approached it another way.

Thanks for reading and good luck if you have an upcoming exam!
